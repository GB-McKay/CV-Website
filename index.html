					<p><b>Web Developer - RBS <br> Oct 2018 - Present</b></p>
					<p>I joined RBS as an Apprentice and quickly gained enough skills and experience to become a Web Developer. I was responsible for coding internal web pages from scratch which were hosted on Confluence. These pages were created to improve the teams communications, stakeholder engagement & project management / governance. I was recognised for the work I delivered, recieving nominations for 3 of the pages I created.</p>
					<p>During my time at RBS I also took part in the Early Careers Challenge. During this competition I led my team to the final of the competition, designing a technical solution to prevent scams. During this competition I implemented the Agile methodology, Design Thinking and Market Analysis to create our product. I was also part of the team that created, design and delivered our pitched to the judging panel.  </p>

					<p>Through my 4 years in recruitment I gained alot of Stakeholder & Client Management experience, which I utilised at RBS. I gathered requirements and set expectations on my deliver times. I was able to build strong relationships with clients and quickly became an Account Manager for one of the UK's leading managed services companies.</p><p>In this position I was able to build strong communication and presentation skills. This was also the start of my design experience as I was responsible for the companies marketing at NSK and RDF.
